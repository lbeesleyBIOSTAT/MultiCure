Package: MultiCure
Title: EM Algorithms for Fitting Multistate Cure Models
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Lauren Beesley
Maintainer: Lauren Beesley <lbeesley@umich.edu>
Description: This R package provides functions for fitting the multistate cure model (originally proposed in Conlon et al. (2013)) using maximum likelihood methods. Model parameters are estimated using the EM or Monte Carlo EM algorithm. Additional methods provide estimates of state occupancy probabilities over time based on a multistate cure model fit.
